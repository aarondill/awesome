  # there are no handled devices.

  # password_prompt: ["gnome-keyring-query", "get", "{id_uuid}"]
  # [string|list] Set command to retrieve passwords. If specified
  # as a list it defines the ARGV array for the program call. If
  # specified as a string, it will be expanded in a shell-like
  # manner. Each string will be formatted using `str.format`. For a
  # list of device attributes, see below. The two special string values
  # "builtin:gui" and "builtin:tty" signify to use udiskie's

  # Any rule can contain multiple filters (AND) and multiple actions.
  # Only the first matching rule that defines a given action is used.
  # The rules defined here are simply prepended to the builtin device rules,
  # so that it is possible to completely overwrite the defaults by specifying
  # a catch-all rule (i.e. a rule without device attributes).

  # Don't show snap loops
  - device_file: /dev/loop*
    id_type: squashfs

  #   -1                      use the libnotify default timeout

  # timeout: 1.5 # set the default for all notifications

  # Specify only if you want to overwrite the default:
  device_mounted: -1 # mount notification
  device_unmounted: -1 # unmount notification
  device_added: false # device has appeared
  device_removed: false # device has disappeared
  device_unlocked: -1 # encrypted device was unlocked

  # notification for the specified event:

  device_mounted: [browse]
