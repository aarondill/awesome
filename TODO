-- TODO: implement notification center (only in awesome-git)
-- awesome-shell@widgets/noti-center.lua is a good place to start
-- This is not possible in v4.3 because naughty is too simple and doesn't provide signals

--TODO: WIDGETS
--Improve all widgets that came with TitusTech's clone.
--  Return functions, take args, default programs, etc...
--  These don't work (I think)
--    Temperature - WORKS? test.
--    Volume - works? patterns?
--    WiFi - spawns defined program, needs fixed. Defined interface. relies on iw - not stable
--    Bluetooth - Not even exists.
--    Hard-Drive - Relies on `df`, and only checks /home
--    Package updater - relies on pamac - not even debian supported.
--    RAM - Uses glob, by accident. External process, can be simplified?
--Make the package widget work with apt (dpkg?) (or any given package).
--  Accept an argument for commands/hooks
--    apt-get -q -y --ignore-hold --allow-change-held-packages --allow-unauthenticated ---simulate dist-upgrade | /bin/grep  ^Inst | wc -l --> 'updates'
--    /usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check 2>&1 --> 'security_updates;regular_updates'
--Use exponential scale. Check ./widget/backlight-adjust.lua for an example
