-- This file is *not* meant to be ran or required. It's only lua for syntax highlighting.
error("You can't require the todo file!")

---Update Package List. (Can I convert ./setup.sh to a lua script? then generate this list in CI?)

---TODO: Async functions (coroutines). No more Callback hell!
---https://github.com/ms-jpq/lua-async-await

-- TODO: implement notification center (only in awesome-git)
-- awesome-shell@widgets/noti-center.lua is a good place to start
-- This is not possible in v4.3 because naughty is too simple and doesn't provide signals

--TODO: WIDGETS
--Improve all widgets that came with TitusTech's clone.
--  Return functions, take args, default programs, etc...
--  These don't work (I think)
--    Temperature - WORKS? test.
--    Volume - works? patterns?
--    WiFi - spawns defined program, needs fixed. Defined interface. relies on iw - not stable
--    Bluetooth - Not even exists.
--    Hard-Drive - Relies on `df`, and only checks /home
--    RAM - Uses glob, by accident. External process, can be simplified?
--Use exponential scale. Check ./widget/backlight-adjust.lua for an example
